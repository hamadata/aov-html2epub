aov-html2epub README
====================

This is a minimal HTML file to EPUB format converter. After, as usual,
being bored + frustrated by the cumbersome available tools to do this
apparently trivial operation, this is my approach. It's just a shell
script. The only dependency is the `zip' program.

If you are searching for a pure text to HTML converter, try
